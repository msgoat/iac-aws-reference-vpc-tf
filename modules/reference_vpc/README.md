# reference_vpc: Terraform module to set up an AWS reference VPCs

Creates a reference network on AWS with a VPC spanning all availability zones of the given AWS region. 

Each availability zone will host a stack of three subnets:
* one public subnet for all internet-facing resources
* one private subnet for application resources
* one private subnet for databases and messaging systems used by your applications

All outbound traffic from private resources running in the private subnets will be routed through NAT gateways 
(one NAT gateway per availability zone).
